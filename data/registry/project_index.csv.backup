## Objectives

## Objectives
- Primary outcome: Test the hypothesis - Hot-subdwarf B (sdB) stars are significant precursors to Type Ia supernovae, contrary to the traditional view of white dwarfs as the primary progenitors. This hypothesis predicts a correlation between the observed numbers of sdB stars and Type Ia supernovae in various galaxies, with a higher incidence of supernovae in galaxies with larger sdB po...

## Objectives

## Objectives
- Primary outcome: Test the hypothesis - Stellar rotation rates in older star clusters are significantly slower than those in younger star clusters. This variation in rotation rates can be measured by analyzing the periodic brightness fluctuations in the light curves of stars across different star clusters. The proposed relationship between age and rotation rate will be most discernibl...
