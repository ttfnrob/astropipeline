# Idea: Stellar Oscillations as Proxies for Stellar Age

**Idea ID:** 01198BF2269863CAA6D5444080
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
Stellar oscillations, as measured through asteroseismology, can be used as a new standard for determining stellar ages in main sequence stars, particularly those of intermediate mass. The frequency and amplitude of these oscillations are predicted to correlate directly with the age of the star, allowing for more precise age determinations than c...

## Rationale
Stellar age determination is critical for understanding stellar evolution, and yet it remains a challenge. Current methods, such as gyrochronology and isochrone fitting, have limitations and uncertainties. However, recent advancements in asteroseismology, especially with data from missions like Kepler and TESS, have allowed for detailed analysis of stellar oscillations. These oscillations are driven by convection and are affected by the internal structure of the star, which changes as the sta...
