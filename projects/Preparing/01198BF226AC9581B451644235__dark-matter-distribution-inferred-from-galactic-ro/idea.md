# Idea: Dark Matter Distribution Inferred from Galactic Rotation Curves and Gravitational Lensing

**Idea ID:** 01198BF226AC9581B451644235
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
Combined analysis of galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing effects can provide a more accurate map of dark matter distribution within galaxies. Specifically, the discrepancy between observed rotation curves and those predicted by visible matter alone can be correlated with gravitational lensing measurements to infer the spatial dist...

## Rationale
Understanding the nature and distribution of dark matter is one of the key challenges in modern astrophysics. While rotation curves and gravitational lensing are both used to infer the presence of dark matter, a combined approach has rarely been applied to map the dark matter distribution within galaxies. Rotation curves from radio surveys like ALFALFA and HI4PI, and lensing data from Hubble or future missions like Euclid and Rubin Observatory, could be analyzed together to achieve this. This...
