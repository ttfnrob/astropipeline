# Idea: Dark Matter Distribution Influences Spatial Variation of Star Formation Rate

**Idea ID:** 01198BF219A7B50F0A206A492F
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
Dark matter within galaxies directly influences spatial variation in star formation rates (SFR). Regions with higher concentrations of dark matter would show higher SFRs, while regions with lower concentrations of dark matter would show lower SFRs. This correlation, if found, would imply a causal relationship between dark matter and star formati...

## Rationale
Despite dark matter's invisibility, its gravitational influence can be inferred from the motion of visible matter. Surveys like Gaia provide velocity distributions for billions of stars, enabling detailed dark matter maps of the Milky Way. Simultaneously, ALMA and Hubble provide comprehensive star formation data. By comparing these datasets, we can look for correlations between dark matter distribution and SFRs. This could enhance our understanding of star formation processes and the role of ...
