# Idea: Dark Matter Distribution as a Key to Understanding Galaxy Rotation Curves

**Idea ID:** 01198BF2204C6DC7F71BD94BE0
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
Dark matter distribution within galaxies is not as homogenous as currently considered. Instead, it follows a complex pattern that directly influences the galaxy's rotation curve. The non-uniformity of dark matter distribution can be inferred from rotational velocities of stars and gas at different radial distances from the galactic center. The s...

## Rationale
The current Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Î›CDM) model fails to explain the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. This discrepancy, known as the 'galaxy rotation problem', indicates our incomplete understanding of dark matter and its distribution. By using the precise velocity data from Gaia and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we can infer the dark matter distribution and its influence on rotation curves. This novel approach would significantly advance our understanding of dark matter ...
