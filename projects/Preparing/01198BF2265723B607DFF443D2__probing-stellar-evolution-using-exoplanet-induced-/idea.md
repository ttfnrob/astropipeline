# Idea: Probing Stellar Evolution Using Exoplanet-Induced Stellar Activity

**Idea ID:** 01198BF2265723B607DFF443D2
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
The interaction between exoplanets and their host stars can induce stellar activities that provide novel insights into stellar interiors and evolution. Specifically, star-planet interactions (SPIs) can cause measurable variations in stellar brightness, chromospheric activity, and star spot distribution, which correlate with the age, rotation rat...

## Rationale
While the influence of stellar activity on exoplanets is well studied, the reverse - the impact of exoplanets on stellar activity - is less explored. Observations from TESS, Kepler, and future JWST missions can provide the necessary data to study SPIs and their effects on stellar activity. This approach not only offers a unique method to study stellar interiors and evolution but also improves our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and habitability. It could potentially reveal unexplored r...
