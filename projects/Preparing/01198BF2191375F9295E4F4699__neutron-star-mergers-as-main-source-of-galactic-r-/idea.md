# Idea: Neutron Star Mergers as Main Source of Galactic r-Process Elements

**Idea ID:** 01198BF2191375F9295E4F4699
**Domain tags:** stellar evolution, galactic dynamics
**Status:** Approved

## Hypothesis
Neutron star mergers are the primary source of heavy r-process elements (those beyond iron in the periodic table) in galaxies. By comparing the spatial distribution of these elements to the distribution of neutron stars and comparing the expected and observed enrichment rates, we can quantify the contribution of neutron star mergers to galactic ...

## Rationale
Current models struggle to explain the observed abundance of r-process elements. The recent discovery of heavy elements in the kilonova associated with the gravitational wave event GW170817 suggests that neutron star mergers could be a significant source. Using data from LIGO/Virgo to locate neutron star mergers, combined with spectroscopic surveys like SDSS/APOGEE to map element distributions, we can test this hypothesis. If true, this would solve a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics and pr...
