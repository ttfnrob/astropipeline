# Lab Technician Meta-Agent 🔧

The Lab Technician is a revolutionary meta-agent that continuously monitors and improves the Experimenter agent's performance, creating a self-evolving research pipeline.

## Overview

The Lab Technician implements a feedback loop that:
1. **Monitors** experimenter execution logs and performance metrics
2. **Analyzes** patterns in failures, errors, and bottlenecks
3. **Identifies** specific improvement opportunities
4. **Generates** targeted code modifications
5. **Applies** safe, incremental improvements
6. **Validates** that changes don't break functionality
7. **Restarts** the experimenter process when needed

This creates a system that learns from its mistakes and continuously improves its research capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Log Mining**: Parses detailed execution logs from the experimenter
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors execution times, success rates, and resource usage
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring failures and their root causes
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Analyzes code complexity and identifies technical debt

### 🛠️ **Intelligent Code Improvement**

## Usage

### Automatic Operation (Continuous Pipeline)

```python
from astroagent.orchestration.continuous_pipeline import ContinuousPipeline

# Create pipeline with lab technician enabled
pipeline = ContinuousPipeline()

# Configure lab technician
pipeline.set_lab_technician_interval(3600)  # Run every hour
pipeline.enable_lab_technician()

# Start continuous operation
await pipeline.run_continuous({
    'domain': 'astrophysics',
    'research_areas': ['stellar_evolution', 'exoplanets']
})
```

### Manual Execution

```python
from astroagent.agents import create_agent
from astroagent.agents.common import AgentExecutionContext

# Create lab technician
lab_tech = create_agent('lab_technician')

# Execute analysis
context = AgentExecutionContext(
    agent_name='lab_technician',
    state_name='manual_analysis',
    input_data={'force_analysis': True}
)

result = lab_tech.run(context)
print(f"Analysis status: {result.success}")
print(f"Improvements made: {len(result.output_data.get('improvements_made', []))}")
```

### Pipeline Control

```python
# Force immediate analysis
result = await pipeline.run_lab_technician_now()

# Enable/disable
pipeline.enable_lab_technician()
pipeline.disable_lab_technician()

# Adjust frequency
pipeline.set_lab_technician_interval(1800)  # 30 minutes
```
